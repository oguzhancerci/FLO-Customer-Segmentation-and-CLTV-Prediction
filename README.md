# Business Problem
FLO wants to segment their customers and determine marketing strategies according to these segments. For this purpose, the behaviors of the customers will be defined, and groups will be created according to these behaviors. Additionally, FLO wants to estimate the potential value that existing customers will provide to the company in the future.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of information obtained from the past shopping behaviors of customers who made their last shopping both online and offline in 2020-2021. The following columns are included in the dataset:

# Methodology
In this project, we used two different methods for customer segmentation and customer value estimation:

# RFM Analysis
We performed an RFM analysis on the dataset to segment customers based on their behavior. RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary. It is a widely used method for customer segmentation based on purchase behavior.

# CLTV Prediction with BG-NBD and Gamma-Gamma
We also used the CLTV Prediction with BG-NBD and Gamma-Gamma method to estimate the potential value that existing customers will provide to the company in the future. This method helps us predict the expected future value of customers based on their past purchase behavior, which enables FLO to estimate customer lifetime value and make data-driven decisions about sales and marketing strategies.

# Conclusion
By using RFM analysis and CLTV Prediction with BG-NBD and Gamma-Gamma methods, we were able to segment FLO's customers based on their behavior and estimate their potential value to the company. We hope that our findings will help FLO set a roadmap for their sales and marketing activities by providing insights into customer segmentation and potential customer value.
